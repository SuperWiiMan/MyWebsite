This is the content of my first post.

I do not know how to put this but first post on my blog.
This site is made with HUGO

This site will be to talk about my interests including but not limited to:
- Arch Linux (On Arch BTW)
- Video games: Nintendo franchises, Forza, Fortnite, No Mans Sky, Minecraft, and more.
- Homebrew/Hardware mods to anything.
- Soldering (Electronics possibly jewelry later)
- ThinkPad (Mostly about my T480 for now)
- Random tech stuff I like and/or find interesting
- Tech minimalism/protecting privacy
- Expect random stuff occasionally

I will try to post at least 5 times a week give or take because life:)
This website will observe April fools you have been warned;)
