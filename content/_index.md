- Arch Linux (On Arch BTW)
- Video games: Nintendo franchises, Forza, Fortnite, No Mans Sky, Minecraft, and more.
- Homebrew/Hardware mods to anything.
- Soldering (Electronics possibly jewelry later)
- ThinkPad (Mostly about my T480 for now)
- Random tech stuff I like and/or find interesting
- Tech minimalism/protecting privacy
- Expect random stuff occasionally
